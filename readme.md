## Jetpack External Url Gallery ##

This plugin is designed to extend Jetpacks Tiled Gallery and Lightbox features. 

Usage:

The shortcode for the gallery remains the same with the addition on a new attribute.

Example: [gallery type="circle" ext_url="http://example.com/pic.jpg" id="12,23"]

As you can see above the plugin only extends the existing shortcode and allows for external images to be inserted.
